Summary: About Ognian Genev

Hi! My name is Ognian Genev, and I'm a data scientist and entrepreneur living in Sofia, Bulgaria.

I try to keep my blog updated with posts about data analysis, data visualization, machine learning and programming projects I'm working on. Some of these are interesting side projects I'm exploring and some of them are solutions to challenging real-world problems that I'm tackling in my professional career. I hope they'll be helpful and interesting to you!

I've been a professional online poker player for 7 years. Math, statistics, risk management, bankro–ªl management, toy games, opponent analysis, game theory and a lot more in online poker gave me a pretty good start when I first dove in the world of data science.

I'm interested in machine learning, data science, tech startups, math and statistics, human-computer interaction... as well as psychology, yoga, meditation, cryptocurrencies and more.
