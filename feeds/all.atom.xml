For nearly half a year I have begun to engage in data science and machine learning, and I really think that's what I would like to do for the future. I've always liked computers since I was a kid, I even remember that at one point I wanted to become a cracker, even my nickname was CrAcKMaStEr 
 It was really fun, I also bought some books for C++ and Java and I started to learn to program. But afterwards something changed, maybe because of the environment I was in, I started to be interested in fitness and started to spend more time in the gym. Programming remained in the background, but I always enjoyed spending a lot of time in front of the computer, I feel like I can do it for all eternity and I will not get tired &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once the enthusiasm for the gym subsided, I began to engage in online poker. A lot of people do not know what it really takes to be a professional online poker player, maybe I have to write a special blog post about it. I was making really good money, but I always knew it was not my path, and I felt I had to change something.
 Towards the end of 2016, with a friend of mine, we decided to make an online reservation platform for beauty  and SPA  salons here in Bulgaria (JOLYY was the name of our company). 
We made a lot of mistakes in the process, but that is quite normal, given that we had no experience. Bitcoin and crypto craze caught up with us and we decided to resurrect the project and go global by making ICOs and trying to find funding from the crypto community. But we met a wall and that's when the Bitcoin bubble burst. After all, the project failed two years later, but the things we learned about online business are very valuable and really irreplaceable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And here I am , enthusiastic about data science, machine learning and artificial intelligence! I know I have a long way to go, and I have a lot to learn, so I decided to share my progress and the things I'm going through. And what better way to do that than starting to write my own blog posts?&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="data science"></category><category term="story"></category><category term="machine learning"></category></entry></feed>
