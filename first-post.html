    <p>Hello, here is my first blog post! </p>
<p>For nearly half a year I have begun to engage in <strong>data science</strong> and <strong>machine learning</strong>, and I really think that's what I would like to do for the future. I've always liked computers since I was a kid, I even remember that at one point I wanted to become a cracker, even my nickname was CrAcKMaStEr :)</p>
<p>It was really fun, I also bought some books for C++ and Java and I started to learn to program. But afterwards something changed, maybe because of the environment I was in, I started to be interested in <strong>bodybuilding</strong> and started to spend more time in the gym. Programming remained in the background, but I always enjoyed spending a lot of time in front of the computer, I feel like I can do it for all eternity and I will not get tired :)</p>
<p>Once the enthusiasm for the gym subsided, I began to engage in <strong>online poker</strong>. A lot of people do not know what it really takes to be a professional online poker player, maybe I have to write a special blog post about it. I was making really good money, but I always knew it was not my path, and I felt I had to change something.</p>
<p>Towards the end of 2016, with a friend of mine, we decided to make an <strong>online reservation platform</strong> for beauty and SPA salons here in <strong>Bulgaria</strong> (JOLYY was the name of our company). 
We made a lot of mistakes in the process, but that is quite normal, given that we had no experience. <strong>Bitcoin and cryptocurrency</strong> craze caught up with us and we decided to resurrect the project and go global by making ICOs and trying to find funding from the crypto community. But we met a wall and that's when the Bitcoin bubble burst. After all, the project failed two years later, but the things we learned about online business are very valuable and really irreplaceable.</p>
<p>And here I am, enthusiastic about data science, machine learning and AI! I know I have a long way to go, and I have a lot to learn, so I decided to share my progress and the things I'm going through. And what better way to do that than starting to write my own blog posts?</p>
